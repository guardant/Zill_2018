# 20k_landscape
# This repository contains the data and analysis for the 20K landscape manuscript Zill et al

This repository contains scripts and data for generating the figure panels from the Zill et al 21,807 patient ctDNA landscape study.

Prior to running all analyses involving comparison to TCGA data, the TCGA variants were downloaded from www.cbioportal.org using the get_cbio_data.r Rscript.  
Note: that the TCGA data for the study were downloaded on 4/25/16, and regenerating the cbMUT.Rdata object using the get_cbio_data.r script will produce a non-equivalent analysis, as the TCGA data have been updated in cBio portal since 4/25/16.  Note also that if DO you wish to generate a new version of the cbMUT data.frame (currently stored as the "cbMUT.Rdata" file), you will have to load it from the output/cbio_alts_data.Rdata file that is generated by get_cbio_data.r (the cbio_alts_data.Rdata file will include the new version of the cbMUT data.frame once the get_cbio_data.r script is run).

# Unpacking the GHLandscape R package & regenerating figure panels #
####################################################################

To regenerate figure panels, do the following from the command line:

1) Clone the repository to you local instance

	> git clone https://github.com/guardant/Zill_2018.git

2) change directories to Zill_2018# all additional commands (Rscript calls) must be executed from within the main package directory
3) Call "Rscript R/ctdna_landscape_analysis.R"
4) All figure panels and tables will be written to /output

Helper scripts:
---------------
get_cbio_data.r		#get TCGA data from cbio portal.
scatterBarOZ.R 		#used by pancan_clonal_frxn.r

Figures code to generate individual figures is commented in ctdna_landscape_analysis.R
